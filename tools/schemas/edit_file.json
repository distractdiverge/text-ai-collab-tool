Specify ONLY the precise lines of code that you wish to edit.\n2. **NEVER specify or write out unchanged code**. Instead, represent all unchanged code using this special placeholder: {{ ... }}.\n3. To edit multiple, non-adjacent lines of code in the same file, make a single call to this tool. Specify each edit in sequence with the special placeholder {{ ... }} to represent unchanged code in between edited lines.\nHere's an example of how to edit three non-adjacent lines of code at once:\nCodeContent:\n{{ ... }}\nedited_line_1\n{{ ... }}\nedited_line_2\n{{ ... }}\nedited_line_3\n{{ ... }}\n\n5. You may not edit file extensions: [.ipynb]\nYou should specify the following arguments before the others: [TargetFile]",
